# Introduction

When I came across the dataset for Pharmaceutical Sales Data, I was instantly intrigued by its extensive and intricate nature. As an individual keen on honing my expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, this dataset presents a perfect opportunity for me to immerse myself and enhance my abilities.

# Problem Statement

- Which pharmaceutical drugs consistently sell the most and the least over the past six years?
- How does the sales performance of the pharmacy evolve over time? Are there any noticeable trends or patterns?
- What is the distribution of sales across different drug categories? Which category contributes the highest share of sales?
- Are there specific months or seasons when the pharmacy experiences significant increases or decreases in sales?
- Is there a correlation between the sales of specific drugs and external factors such as advertising campaigns, promotions, or seasonal events?

# Data Sourcing

The dataset consists of pharmaceutical transactional data collected over a period of 6 years (2014-2019), stored in a CSV file. It includes information on the date, time, pharmaceutical drug brand name, and quantity sold. The dataset comprises 57 drugs classified into different therapeutic categories based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System.

Sourced from the Point-of-Sale system used by the pharmacy, the CSV file provides a rich source of information for analysis. The goal is to analyze the sales data of these pharmaceutical drugs and gain insights that can help improve business performance and drive growth for the Pharmacy.

##  Data Transformation (ETL Process)

The data transformation process focused on ensuring high data quality before analysis. Using **Power Query**, I performed the following ETL tasks:

### Extract
- Loaded raw transactional data directly from the pharmacy's Point-of-Sale system into Power BI.

### Transform
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed records with missing or null values in critical fields (e.g., date, drug name).
  - Corrected data types for accurate analysis (e.g., date, text, integer).
  - Standardized drug brand names for consistency.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted key date components (year, month, day) to enable trend analysis.
  - Created new calculated columns such as `TotalSalesRevenue` and `TimeOfDay` for more granular analysis.
- **Categorization**:
  - Mapped drugs into their respective ATC therapeutic categories for enhanced analysis.

### Load
- Loaded the cleaned and transformed dataset into Power BI for visualization and further analysis.

# Data Model Design

### ðŸ“¸ Data Model Snapshot:
![Power BI Data Model](images/images/Data_Model.png)

## Overview

The data model is a crucial part of any data analysis or reporting process. In this project, we have used a **Star Schema** to structure the data. A Star Schema is widely used in data warehousing for its simplicity and efficiency in data retrieval, especially in analytical environments. The central component of the model is the **Fact Table**, which contains the transactional data, and it connects to various **Dimension Tables**, which contain descriptive or categorical data.

This design allows for flexible, high-performance querying and makes it easier to analyze different aspects of the data. Below is a detailed explanation of the data model and the relationships between the tables.

## Tables and Relationships

### Fact Table (`fact_table`)

The **Fact Table** serves as the center of the data model. It contains transactional data, such as sales, usage, or other metrics related to the business. In this model, the **Fact Table** stores entries with the following key attributes:
- **Drug ID**: Identifies the specific drug.
- **Hour**: The time at which the transaction occurred.
- **Real Date**: The specific date when the transaction took place.

### Dimension Tables

The **Dimension Tables** provide descriptive information about the metrics stored in the **Fact Table**. Each dimension table is linked to the **Fact Table** using a specific key, creating the relationships that allow for meaningful analysis. In this design, the following Dimension Tables are used:

1. **Drug Table (`drug_table`)**
   - Contains detailed information about each drug, such as its name, category, manufacturer, and other attributes.
   - **Key Column**: `Drug ID`, which links to the **Fact Table**.

2. **Time Table (`time_table`)**
   - Contains time-related information such as the hour of the day, day of the week, month, and year.
   - **Key Column**: `Hour`, which links to the **Fact Table**.

3. **Real Date Table (`real_date_table`)**
   - Contains calendar-related information such as the actual date, week number, month, quarter, and year.
   - **Key Column**: `Real Date`, which links to the **Fact Table**.

## Relationships Between Tables

### 1. **Fact Table â†’ Drug Table**
   - The relationship between the **Fact Table** and the **Drug Table** is based on the **Drug ID**.
   - In the **Fact Table**, each entry corresponds to a specific drug, and the **Drug ID** field in the **Fact Table** is linked to the **Drug ID** field in the **Drug Table**.
   - **Cardinality**: This relationship is a **Many-to-One** relationship, meaning many entries in the **Fact Table** (representing multiple transactions) are related to a single entry in the **Drug Table** (representing one drug).
   - **Reasoning**: This relationship allows the data to be aggregated and analyzed by different drug characteristics (e.g., drug category, manufacturer).

### 2. **Fact Table â†’ Time Table**
   - The relationship between the **Fact Table** and the **Time Table** is based on the **Hour** field.
   - Each transaction in the **Fact Table** has an associated time, and the **Hour** field in the **Fact Table** is linked to the **Hour** field in the **Time Table**.
   - **Cardinality**: This is a **Many-to-One** relationship, where many records in the **Fact Table** (representing multiple transactions) relate to a single record in the **Time Table** (representing one specific hour of the day).
   - **Reasoning**: This allows the analysis of transactions across different time periods, such as hours of the day, weekdays, etc.

### 3. **Fact Table â†’ Real Date Table**
   - The relationship between the **Fact Table** and the **Real Date Table** is based on the **Real Date** field.
   - In the **Fact Table**, each transaction is associated with a specific date, and the **Real Date** field in the **Fact Table** links to the **Real Date** field in the **Real Date Table**.
   - **Cardinality**: This is a **Many-to-One** relationship, meaning multiple records in the **Fact Table** can correspond to a single date in the **Real Date Table**.
   - **Reasoning**: This relationship allows for analysis over time, where you can aggregate data by day, week, month, quarter, or year.

## Data Model Schema: Star Schema

In a Star Schema, the **Fact Table** sits at the center, and all related **Dimension Tables** surround it. This model is designed to facilitate fast query performance, especially in analytics, by minimizing the number of joins required. The relationships are clear and straightforward, allowing for intuitive data exploration.

- The **Fact Table** contains the measures (e.g., sales, quantity, etc.), while the **Dimension Tables** provide context to those measures.
- The **Fact Table** is connected to each **Dimension Table** via a foreign key, which corresponds to the primary key of the related dimension.
- This setup enables users to easily filter, group, and analyze the data by any dimension (e.g., by drug, by time, by date).

## Why Star Schema?

The **Star Schema** was chosen for this data model for the following reasons:
1. **Simplicity**: The schema is simple to understand and easy to implement, making it ideal for quick reporting and analysis.
2. **Performance**: The Star Schema reduces the number of joins between tables, which improves query performance, especially when working with large datasets.
3. **Flexibility**: It allows users to slice the data across multiple dimensions, making it versatile for different types of analysis.
4. **Scalability**: As the dataset grows, the Star Schema remains efficient, and new dimensions can be easily added to the model.

## Summary

This data model is structured to provide efficient and scalable analysis by organizing the data into a central **Fact Table** and related **Dimension Tables**. The relationships between the tables allow for easy filtering, aggregation, and exploration of the data, making it suitable for various business intelligence tasks.

- The **Fact Table** holds transactional data such as drug usage, time of transaction, and date.
- The **Dimension Tables** provide descriptive details about the drugs, time, and dates, enabling the analysis to be done from different perspectives.
- The relationships between the tables are set up as **Many-to-One**, ensuring that each record in the Fact Table corresponds to a single record in each Dimension Table.

This model provides a strong foundation for performing meaningful analysis and deriving insights from the data.
