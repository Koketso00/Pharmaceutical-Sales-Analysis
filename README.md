This repository presents an in-depth analysis of sales data from Mary's Pharmacy, a small pharmacy located in a busy city center

# Introduction

When I came across the dataset for Mary's Pharmacy, I was instantly intrigued by its extensive and intricate nature. As an individual keen on honing my expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, this dataset presents a perfect opportunity for me to immerse myself and enhance my abilities.

# Problem Statement

- Which pharmaceutical drugs consistently sell the most and the least over the past six years?
- How does the sales performance of the pharmacy evolve over time? Are there any noticeable trends or patterns?
- What is the distribution of sales across different drug categories? Which category contributes the highest share of sales?
- Are there specific months or seasons when the pharmacy experiences significant increases or decreases in sales?
- Is there a correlation between the sales of specific drugs and external factors such as advertising campaigns, promotions, or seasonal events?

# Data Sourcing

The dataset for Mary's Pharmacy consists of transactional data collected over a period of 6 years (2014-2019). It includes information on the date, time, pharmaceutical drug brand name, and quantity sold. The dataset comprises 57 drugs classified into different therapeutic categories based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System.

This dataset was sourced from the Point-of-Sale system used by the pharmacy, providing a rich source of information for analysis. The goal is to analyze the sales data of these pharmaceutical drugs and gain insights that can help improve business performance and drive growth for Mary's Pharmacy.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Transformation

The dataset underwent a thorough data cleaning process using **Power Query** to ensure its quality and usability. The following steps were taken:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Removed rows with missing or null values in critical fields such as date and drug brand name.
2. **Data Type Corrections**: Ensured that columns were assigned the correct data types (e.g., date, text, integer).
3. **Standardization**: Standardized drug names to maintain consistency across the dataset.
4. **Date Extraction**: Extracted year, month, and day components for trend analysis.
5. **Classification**: Categorized drugs into their respective ATC therapeutic groups.

## üìê Data Modeling Summary

I designed a **Star Schema** data model with **one-to-one relationships** to optimize the analysis of Mary's Pharmacy sales data. The model includes a **central Fact Table (`SalesFactTable`)** and three Dimension Tables (`DrugTable`, `DateTable`, and `TimeTable`):

- **`SalesFactTable`**: Central table containing detailed sales data, including:
  - `TransactionID`, `DrugID`, `DateID`, `TimeID`, `QuantitySold`, and `TotalSales`.

- **`DrugTable`**: Contains descriptive attributes of each drug:
  - `DrugID`, `DrugName`, `DrugCategory`.

- **`DateTable`**: Includes all date-related attributes for analysis:
  - `DateID`, `FullDate`, `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Quarter`, and `WeekNumber`.

- **`TimeTable`**: Contains temporal data for time-based analysis:
  - `TimeID`, `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second`.

### üí° Key Relationships:
- **One-to-One relationship** between `SalesFactTable` and `DrugTable` via `DrugID`.
- **One-to-One relationship** between `SalesFactTable` and `DateTable` via `DateID`.
- **One-to-One relationship** between `SalesFactTable` and `TimeTable` via `TimeID`.

- **Category Sales Distribution**: Evaluated the contribution of each drug category to total sales.
- **Peak Sales Periods**: Determined peak sales hours and days of the week.


## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: Used for visualizing and creating interactive dashboards to analyze the sales data.
- **Power Query**: Used for data transformation and cleaning, including merging tables, filtering, and shaping data for analysis.
- **Excel**: Initially used for exploratory analysis and data validation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Utilized for creating custom calculations and measures in Power BI, such as Total Sales and Average Sales per Day.
- **Power BI Service**: Published and shared the interactive Power BI report/dashboard.
